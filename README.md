# Click-info
A program to record left and right mouse click data and plot them visually.
Visual representation can help to gain insights on the user like - his nature of work, 
whether he/she is gaming, etc


## Instructions for running the program
Run the the click_info.ipynb file to start recording and stop it by just interrupting thr kernel.
After stopping, it generates 2 separate pickle files to store the right and left click data separately.
Then, run the clickinfo_data_retrieval.ipynb to plot and display the data.

Sample pickle files are uploaded, along with code to store the values in a csv file.
**Note that the data files are overwritten each time the recording program is run.**



### Requirements:
```
pip install mouse
