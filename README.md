# Click-info
A program to record left and right mouse click data and plot them visually.
Visual representation can help to gain insights on the user like - his nature of work, 
whether he/she is gaming, etc


## Instructions for running the program
Run the the click_info.ipynb file to start recording and stop it by just interrupting thr kernel.
(2 pickle files to store the right and left click data separately are must for recording datewise data.) 
Then, run the clickinfo_data_retrieval.ipynb to plot and display the data.
Feature for choosing date will be added later.

**Make sure the pickle files are in the same directory as the ipynb files.**

Sample pickle files are uploaded, along with code to store the values in a csv file.

~~**Note that the data files are overwritten each time the recording program is run.**~~



### Requirements:
```
pip install mouse
```
